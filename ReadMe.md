# Kama(Sutra) ♋ Git Commit Msg

## The reasons for these conventions:
- 🔥 spice up you commit messages
- ⚡ less words in your commit history, more emojis
- 📃 automatic generating of the changelog
- 🧭 simple navigation through git history (e.g. ignoring style changes)

## Format of the commit message:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<issue number>
<body>
```

## Example commit message:

```bash
🍆(middleware): ensure Range headers adhere more closely to RFC 2616

🛏 #MIT-2310

Add one new dependency, use `range-parser` (Express dependency) to compute
range. It is more well-tested in the wild.

```

## Message subject (first line)
The first line cannot be longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank and
other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters. The type and scope should
always be lowercase as shown below.

### Allowed `<type>` values:

* 🔥 (**hot thing**: new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
* 🍆 (**get fixed** bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
* 🅱 (**spell dat** changes to the documentation)
* 💃🏼 (**got attitude** formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
* 👌🏼 (**round two** refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
* 👅 (**taste me** adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* 😇 (**gotta do sometimes** updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
* 🍾 (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

### Example `<scope>` values:

* init
* runner
* watcher
* config
* web-server
* proxy
* etc.

The `<scope>` can be empty (e.g. if the change is a global or difficult
to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are
omitted. For example, when updating a package the `<scope>` is empty e.g. 😇: Update MyPackage to 1.2.3


## Message body 👯‍♀️
* **Confidence is sexy:** uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”.
* **Calculate your moves** includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

### Breaking changes 💔

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the
description of the change, justification and migration notes.
```bash
BREAKING CHANGE:

`port-runner` command line option has changed to `runner-port`, so that it is
consistent with the configuration file syntax.

To migrate your project, change all the commands, where you use `--port-runner`
to `--runner-port`.
```


## Issue Number 🔢

### Referencing issues
Closed issues should be listed on a separate line prefixed with "🛏"(put to bed) emoji like this:
```bash
🛏 #234
```
or in the case of multiple issues:
```bash
🛏 #123, #245, #992
```

For Windows: *`win + .`* opens up the emoji keyboard.
